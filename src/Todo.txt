Implement Top Vertical tab

Implement Bottom Vertical tab

Implement Tab::w_page

Implement grabber read/write so themes can be stored in data files

Implement left, top, etc. for moving in all controls (some have it...)

Not all controls paint inactive state correctly (or at all...)

Idea:  Create graphics object, and have all drawing go through it, that way it
can be easily ported

Modify scroll's to make thumb size relative to page size (maybe just a paint
change???).  This is a HIGH PRIORITY item, before ANY public releases.

Should callbacks for menu-down/menu-up, etc. be provided?  Sometimes useful for
enablement of items, etc.

Add fore/back color's to all primitive controls.

Modify theme support in controls to allow style changes ont he fly.

Add file i/o for all controls:  XML for text, as well as binary

Find a way to iterate the boost::signals slots, so that typeid.name() can be
used to dump the names of the objects that are connected to them.  This will
help with debugging imensely in some circumstances.
