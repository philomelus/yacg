Implement Top Vertical tab

Implement Bottom Vertical tab

Implement Tab::w_page

Implement grabber read/write so themes can be stored in data files

Implement left, top, etc. for moving in all controls (some have it...)

Not all controls paint inactive state correctly (or at all...)

Idea:  Create graphics object, and have all drawing go through it, that way it
can be easily ported

Modify scroll's to make thumb size relative to page size (maybe just a paint
change???).  This is a HIGH PRIORITY item, before ANY public releases.

Should callbacks for menu-down/menu-up, etc. be provided?  Sometimes useful for
enablement of items, etc.

Add fore/back color's to all primitive controls.

Modify theme support in controls to allow style changes ont he fly.

Add file i/o for all controls:  XML for text, as well as binary

Find a way to iterate the boost::signals slots, so that typeid.name() can be
used to dump the names of the objects that are connected to them.  This will
help with debugging imensely in some circumstances.

It'd be nice to provide not only a dialog/window editor, but a code generator
who's sole purpose is to provide a prototype for a new control.  For example,
it could provide checkboxes for what features to supprt, what class to derive
from, etc. and then generate the theme.hpp, control.hpp, and control.cpp for
the class automatically.  Pretty simple and easy to write, and would make the
lives of the programmer user MUCH easier - which is the whole point of YACG
to begin with!  I think this should be the FIRST tool created, even before
the dialog editor.
